# I make robots that can see the world
I began my career at [ASV](https://www.l3harris.com/all-capabilities/custom-asv) as an autonomous systems R&D engineer, developing machine learning image classification systems for USVs, including a research project for Innovate UK to evaluate the impact of synthetic data sets on the training of CNN classifiers. I contributed to the advancement of USV sensing solutions, employing hybrid sensor approaches for positioning and navigating USVs, particularly for launch and recovery operations.

I specialize in coaching software development teams in agile principles, utilizing XP, Scrum, and other frameworks tailored to meet the unique needs of each team and product.
