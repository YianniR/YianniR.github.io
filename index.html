    <h1>I make robots that can see the world</h1>
    <p>I began my career at <a href="https://www.l3harris.com/all-capabilities/custom-asv">ASV</a> as an autonomous systems R&D engineer, developing machine learning image classification systems for USVs, including a research project for Innovate UK to evaluate the impact of synthetic data sets on the training of CNN classifiers. I contributed to the advancement of USV sensing solutions, employing hybrid sensor approaches for positioning and navigating USVs, particularly for launch and recovery operations.</p>
